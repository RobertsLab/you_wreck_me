Calculate length depth ratio for oysters from different populations...
```{r}
# Step 1: Read the CSV file into a data frame
data <- read.csv("~/github/you_wreck_me/data/13-oyster-length-depth.csv")

# Step 2: Calculate the ratio (length / depth)
data$length_to_depth_ratio <- data$length / data$depth

# You can also write the results back to a new CSV file if needed
write.csv(data, "~/github/you_wreck_me/output/13-oyster-length-depth-ratio.csv")

# Print the resulting data frame with the calculated ratio
print(data)

```
