```{r, engine='bash'}

curl -L https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jGW1Nv6c5Hy132QUMRElk4ewCfDuCLfwiLPpfHapQZA/export?exportFormat=csv | tee ~/you_wreck_me/data/cold-room.csv
```

## Read in the data to your R environment

```{r}
animalRoom <- read.csv(file = "~/you_wreck_me/data/cold-room.csv")
```

## Messing around
```{r}
animalRoom2 <- na.omit(animalRoom) # get rid of na's
animalRoom2$date <- mdy(animalRoom2$date) #converting the date column to  mdy
```

:p 

```{r}
ggplot(animalRoom2, aes(x=date, y = attached_zooids)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Attached Zooid Count Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Attached Zooids")
```
